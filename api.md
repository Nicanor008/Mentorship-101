# API

Let's take a real life scenario. You in restaurant and call the waiter, place a food order. THe waiter goes back gives out the order to the chef, who reads through the order and serves the food, gives back to the waiter who then brings your order. All that time, you have been waiting for the waiter to respond to the request.

Back to software this is the same, The waiter is our API, we place requests and as users we wait for the request to be fulfilled. If the request is not found, an empty message is given back and we respond with another request or exit.

An API is like an intermediary point of the user and server. Client posts data to the API, that gives it to the server. The server responds with a message to the API. The API then gives the message to the user.

We always interact with APIs in our daily lives. 

As a backend Developer, you will developer the API, test it to ensure its working. As a backend developer, you will generate endpoints that will be consumed by the frontend engineer to ensure fulfillment of client requests.
