# Developer RoadMap

There are several paths\(career\) in software.

First lets distinguish between a developer and an engineer. The two are almost the same. From my view, a **Software Engineer** is involved throughout the process of making the software, that include from collecting data, analysis, designing, maintenance and testing\(through software development life cycle\). A **Software Developer**  is only involved during development\(coding\) of the software.

 The different paths include

* Web Developer - for web apps
  * Front End Developer - only the user interfaces and user experience of web app
  * Backend - how data will be flowing in the webapp
  * Full Stack - concerns with both front-end and backend
* Mobile Developer
  * Android developer
  * iOS developer
* Game Developer
* DevOps Engineer 
* Designer
* Machine Learner
* Robotics engineer
* Data Scientist
* AI engineer

Identify one path, focus and major on it. Don't focus on knowing everything at once.
