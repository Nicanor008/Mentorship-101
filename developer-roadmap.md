# Developer RoadMap

### How many Ways?

First lets distinguish between a developer and an engineer. The two are almost the same. From my view, a **Software Engineer** is involved throughout the process of making the software, that include from collecting data, analysis, designing, maintenance and testing\(through software development life cycle\). A **Software Developer**  is only involved during development\(coding\) of the software.

 The different paths include

* Web Developer - for web apps
  * Front End Developer - only the user interfaces and user experience of web app
  * Backend - how data will be flowing in the webapp
  * Full Stack - concerns with both front-end and backend
* Mobile Developer
  * Android developer
  * iOS developer
* Game Developer
* DevOps Engineer 
* Designer
* Machine Learner
* Robotics engineer
* Data Scientist
* AI engineer

Identify one path, focus and major on it. Don't focus on knowing everything at once.

### Note

Depending on the roadmap you have chosen, find the right resources to learn. On this platform, Coding 101, you will learn web development\([HTML](https://mentorship101.gitbook.io/mentorship-101/html), [CSS](https://mentorship101.gitbook.io/mentorship-101/css-basics), [Javascript](https://mentorship101.gitbook.io/mentorship-101/javascript)\),  Backend\(API - nodejs and python\). Android resources will be provided later. 

It's advisable you start with [GIT-version control](https://mentorship101.gitbook.io/mentorship-101/git-version-control) then [General programming](https://mentorship101.gitbook.io/mentorship-101/general-programming) if you not interested in HTML and CSS.

If you interested in other languages like Java, PHP,  Python, C, C++, Go, etc, start with [General programming ](https://mentorship101.gitbook.io/mentorship-101/general-programming)to get some ideas of what really happens.
