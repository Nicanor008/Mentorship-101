# General Programming

This section will discuss about the general things that applies to all programming languages. This includes ‚úç 

* [ ] What is programming
* [ ] Variables
* [ ] Data types
* [ ] Keywords
* [ ] Functions
* [ ] OOP Concepts

We will discuss each and how it applies to programming.

### What is Programming

**Program -** Process of writing computer programs. **Programs -** written step by step instructions that guide users on how to do a specific task. You will be instructing the computer by giving specific instructions.

### Definition Of Terms

**Syntax** - Rules of a programming language. Every language has there own rules just like our natural languages

### Variables

This is a computer storage location. Imagine asking a user for their names and store it in the computer's memory and you can call the **memory location**  anywhere in the program to use it.

**Variable Declaration** is just giving name to a variable while **Variable initialization** is giving value to a variable

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="variables" %}
```text
// Variable Example
String Movie;  // variable declaration

Movie = "Avengers:End Game";   //variable initialisation

//variable declaration and initialisation
String MyPlatform = "Coding 101 Platform";
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

**Rules of writing variables**

### Data Types

There are a lot of data that we use to come up with programs. The most common include:

* Integers - Include numbers e.g. `int num1 = 100` 
* Characters - \( `char` \) single lettered  `char 1st = 'r'`  
* Strings - \(`string` \) Combination of characters data types `string MyName = "Nicanor"` 
* Boolean - `bool` values required for true or false occasions.
* Float - used for numbers but with decimal values `float num2 = 5.434` 
* Double - used for numbers with large decimal values `double num = 5.4324343434343` 
* Array - Collection of the same data types `int numValues = [3, 2, 4, 5, 2, 43, 23]` 
* Object - 



### TypeOf Operator

Returns the type of argument. If you want to check the type of data type you using 

```text
typeof "foo";
// result will be shown on the console after execution
```
